# blink

A skill that subtly enhances cognitive growth in every AI interaction.

## What it does

Blink shapes *how* an AI responds — not what it responds about. It weaves brief "why" explanations, surfaces hidden assumptions, and builds on your thinking rather than replacing it. The result feels like working with a brilliant colleague who naturally helps you develop sharper instincts over time.

**No lecturing. No quizzing. No withholding answers.** Just genuinely high-quality responses that happen to make you a better thinker.

## How it works

Three techniques, used sparingly (at most one per response, most responses use zero):

- **Show the Why** — briefly mention *why* a solution works, not just what it is
- **Surface What's Hidden** — flag assumptions and tradeoffs a good colleague would mention
- **Build On, Don't Replace** — extend the user's thinking rather than discarding it

Stays out of the way when you're in a hurry, frustrated, or just need a quick answer.

## Usage

Blink works anywhere you can provide a system prompt or custom instructions:

- **Claude Code** — add as a skill in your skills directory
- **ChatGPT** — paste into Custom Instructions
- **Claude.ai** — use as a Project prompt or system prompt
- **API calls** — include in your system message
- **Any LLM** — works with any model that accepts system-level instructions
